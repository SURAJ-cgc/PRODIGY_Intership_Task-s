üöÄ Ultra Advanced Password Generator üöÄ
This Python tool is an Ultra Advanced Password Generator designed to create highly secure and complex passwords. It goes beyond basic random generation by incorporating unique features like weighted character selection, advanced case patterning, diverse symbol inclusion (including Unicode), and comprehensive password strength analysis.

‚ú® Key Features
Weighted Letter Generation: Prioritizes uncommon letters (Q, X, Z, J, etc.) to enhance unpredictability.

Complex Case Patterns: Applies sophisticated case variations like alternating, pyramid, wave, Fibonacci, and random bursts.

Diverse Symbol Inclusion: Generates passwords with basic, advanced, and a wide range of Unicode symbols.

Character Substitution (Leetspeak): Intelligently substitutes characters (e.g., 'a' with '@' or '4') for added complexity.

Comprehensive Strength Analysis: Provides Shannon entropy, a strength score (0-100), detailed character distribution, and pattern complexity analysis.

Crack Time Estimation: Estimates the time it would take to crack a password under various attack scenarios (online, offline, quantum computing, etc.).

Interactive CLI: Easy-to-use menu for generating single or multiple passwords and analyzing password strength.

Security Recommendations: Offers advice on improving password strength and secure hash storage practices.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
This tool is a single Python script. No special installation is needed beyond having Python 3 installed.

Save the code: Save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., ultra_password_generator.py).

Run: Execute the script from your terminal:

Bash

python ultra_password_generator.py
üöÄ Usage
The tool provides an interactive command-line interface. Simply run the script and follow the on-screen menu options:

Generate single/multiple ultra-complex passwords: Choose your desired length (15-20 characters) and a complexity level (Standard, High, or Maximum).

Generate and analyze password strength: Creates a new password and provides a detailed security breakdown.

Analyze YOUR password: Enter your own password (input is hidden) to get a full security assessment, including estimated crack times and personalized recommendations.
